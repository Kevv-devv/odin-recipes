This is the README file for my odin-recipes project. This is the first github project I am working on for the online, open-source Odin Project. This project contains a home page with links to three recipe pages. By completing this project, I learned to put into practice the basics of HTML, including how to set up and employ standard boilerplate code, titles, headings, and lists. Included are three of my favorite recipes!
